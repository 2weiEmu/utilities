# simple table maker for regex

make sure you have python and tkinter installed.
run the program
insert the values you want in your table into the text box like so

```
"col1 row1" "col2 row1" "col3 row1"
"col1 row2" "col2 row2" "col3 row2" "col4 row2"
```

like in the example the amount of columns can be mistmatched that is not an issue.
Once you click the button it will present you with the table in latex format in the same text box.

This tool is very basic, if you really wanna add more things to it you are welcome to do so, but honestly at this point just make it a CLI thing.
